How to mine Yenten in 32 bits on an iPhone.

Install iSH (through testlight): https://ish.app

apk add git #if you want to grab code from github
apk add openssh # alternative I use at home to copy the code using scp in dev mode
apk add python python-dev py-setuptools
apk add gcc
apk add musl-dev



git clone ... or copy code
cd <dir>
python setup.py build

you can do python setup.py install if you want to avoid the following step:

#ignore the warnings. The code contains optimizations which will be ignore through the build...

cp build/lib*/*.so .

#edit ni.sh to put your pool and address details (or leave mine if you really prefer)


./ni.sh
